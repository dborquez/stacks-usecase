Security Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security issues can be reported to Intel's security incident response team via
`https://intel.com/security <https://intel.com/security>`_.

Coding Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We love pep8 (except for the line length of 79, we deem a length of 90 is good), and use black to ensure that coding
style is consitent, please run ``black xx.py`` if you are making any change to python files.

Mailing List
^^^^^^^^^^^^

See our public `mailing list <https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/stacks>`_ page for details on how to contact us. You should only subscribe to the Stacks mailing lists using an email address that you don't mind being public.
